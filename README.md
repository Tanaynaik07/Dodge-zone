# Survival Game

A fun and challenging survival game where you must dodge obstacles to keep the player alive for as long as possible. The game gets harder as you progress through different levels!

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Control the player (a cyan circle) using:
  - **Keyboard**: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys for movement.
  - **Mobile Devices**: Drag the joystick on the on-screen touchpad.
- Dodge different types of obstacles:
  - **Red Obstacles**: Normal speed.
  - **Yellow Obstacles**: Fast-moving.
  - **Purple Obstacles**: Bouncing obstacles with unpredictable movement.
- **Score Points** by dodging obstacles as they exit the screen:
  - Red = +1 Point
  - Yellow = +2 Points
  - Purple = +3 Points
- **Increase Levels** when your score's cube root is an integer (e.g., 8, 27, 64, etc.). As the level increases:
  - More obstacles appear.
  - Obstacles spawn more frequently.
